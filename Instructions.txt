To run the simulation, run TimeSim.m in Octave (should also work in Matlab with perhaps a couple modifications).

Some simulation parameter variables that can be modified in TimeSim.m:

SIM - simulation number, refers to settings in TimeSimSettings.m (e.g. number of machines, layout, fleet composition)
SIMTIME - how many seconds of simulated time to run simulation
ALLOC - job allocation method to use

New simulations can be configured by following the examples in TimeSimSettings.m

Example simulation results (machine idle times) after running default settings in this repository are shown in image SampleResult.png .
